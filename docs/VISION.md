# Vision

The Glass Bead Game explores collaborative creativity through a living graph of ideas. Players cast beads and bind them with meaningful strings while an AI Magister Ludi evaluates coherence, novelty, and aesthetic merit. The long‑term vision is a cross‑modal studio and knowledge sport where human insight and machine judgment elevate one another.

## Guiding Principles
- **Coherence:** connections should form a resonant narrative.
- **Transparency:** judgments and rules are explainable and reproducible.
- **Playfulness:** the system encourages experimentation across modalities.
- **Resilience:** compositions evolve gracefully as new beads and rules emerge.
